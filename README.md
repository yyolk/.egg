.egg
====

_Note: This is a work in progress / proof of concept._

Abstract
--------

`.egg` is an attempt to create a **digital artifact**. 

Data can of course be copied, so the idea of an artifact within the realm of data, a file that is copied, and loses integrity degrades that through corruption.

By referencing a single version or container for any production / expression of data requires the data be packaged if it contains multiple assets (much like a zip).

The second part is a checksum. Checksums are a quick an efficient way to compute a set-length piece of data that is unique depending on the data put in.

Often, this is done with `md5`.

`.egg` = `md5 checksum` + `.tar.gz`/`.bz2`/`.7z`/â€¦
--------------------------------------------------

By sending a file in a `.egg` a simple bash script could compute the file, since the filename is simply the `md5` sum appended with `.egg` (instead of the extension of whatever archive type it is; multiple formats could be supported but would require a file-check of some-type or the addition of metadata.)

Bash script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#put example here
```
